# Time-Series-Model

In this project, I used the Craigslist Vehicles Dataset available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbaabuharun/craigslist-vehicles) to create a Time-Series Model.

Here are the steps that I followed:

I addressed missing values in the dataset by filling numeric with mean and categorical with mode

I converted the 'posting_date' column to a datetime data type.

Utilized the 'posting_date' column to create a datetime index for the dataset.

Build the time-series chart.
